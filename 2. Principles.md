# Principles
There are a lot of ways to measure code quality. Here are a few.

Good Code [^10-principles-of-good-design]

## Is Honest
Honest code doesn't just tell the truth, it helps make it clear and understood.
Clear naming makes a function or variable understood.
An object's schema must represent a single, unified type.
- no "parameter-loading", adding disassociated properties to an object to force the function signature to use fewer.

## Makes the Software Understandable
It clarifies the code's structure.
At best, it is self-explanatory.
- group related code (data and functions) into smaller files or functions
- use vertical spacing to clearly show related code within a single file or function
- advance sequentially, top-to-bottom when possible (see also: immutable, expressions)

## Is As Little Code As Possible
Prefer less syntax to more.
Every word must convey something that is not communicated anywhere else.
Every line must convey no more and no less than what it does.
Each function should do one and only one thing.
- a function should not have a side-effect AND a return value

| Warning: As little as possible does NOT mean terse. It is as little as possible to effectively communicate intent.|
