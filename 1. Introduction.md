## Perspectives

For **developers** — maintainable, enjoyable code[^1]

For **product/management** — predictable, bug-free features[^2]

For **the business** — make money[^3]

## Plan
In order to sustain a pace of predictable feature delivery (the goal)
-   developer productivity must be high

Developer productivity is improved by
-   thorough and accurate feature requirements
-   understandability of the code (logical and familiar/common)
-   confidence in changes to the code (ready for change, adaptable)
-   good morale (pleasant developer experience)

### Developer Perspective
_maintainable, enjoyable code_

Code that is not maintainable is not _enjoyable._

That does _not_ mean that code that _is_ maintainable is also enjoyable.

**What prevents maintainable code?**
